# Mystery Tests / Example Solutions

This directory contains test files that also serve as example solutions for each mystery.

## Running Tests

Make sure the server is running first:
```bash
bun run dev
```

Then in another terminal, run the tests:

```bash
# Run all mystery tests
bun test
```

## Test Files

Each test file demonstrates the complete solution for a mystery.

## How Tests Work

Each test file:
1. Fetches the mystery from the API
2. Solves each clue step-by-step by calling external APIs
3. Submits answers to verify correctness
4. Logs the solution process with detailed output
5. Exits with code 0 if all clues are solved correctly

## Writing New Tests

When adding a new mystery to `mysteries.yaml`, create a corresponding test file:

1. Copy an existing test file (e.g., `myst_001_solution.ts`)
2. Rename it to match your mystery ID (e.g., `myst_004_solution.ts`)
3. Update the solution logic for each clue
4. Add the test script to `package.json`
5. Add it to `run-all.ts`

This ensures every mystery has a verified working solution!
